</u>
</h1>
<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
<div>
<p>

Tripunithura (also spelled Thrippunithura) is a prominent suburb of Kochi, in Ernakulam district, Kerala.It is often called the “Royal Town” because it was the capital of the erstwhile Kingdom of Cochin.Some latter day Sanskrit enthusiasts describe the origin of the name to "purna veda puri" — the town of Vedas in its entirety. Another possible origin to name comes from the meaning "the land on the shores of Poorna river" above doesn't give sense. Thirupunithra = Thiru punitha thara (or Thiru Punitha Thura) means the land that which is holy(thara literally means a platform or an elevated stage). The word Pooni has multiple means, two of which are 'bullocks', 'a type of water bird'. Pooni might also refer to the bag used to carry arrows.
